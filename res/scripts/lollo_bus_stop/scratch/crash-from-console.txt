 go to the test game and type:

 >> edgeId = 25754
 >> edgeIdTyped = api.type.EdgeId.new()
 >> edgeIdTyped.entity = edgeId
 >> edgeIdTyped.index = 1
 >> edgeIdDirTyped = api.type.EdgeIdDir.new(edgeIdTyped, true)
 >> port0 = api.engine.transport.getEndPort(edgeIdDirTyped)
 >> port1 = api.engine.transport.getStartPort(edgeIdDirTyped)

 With beta 35050, this used to crash the game, 35128 does not - but was it really this? I am not sure.
 At any rate, the crash is still there.
